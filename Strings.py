# if we store any string in the variable 
# the way any string is stored is through index values which starts from 0
# for example

word = 'alphabet'
word[0]

# the word at 0 index value is a
# we can do string slicing 
word[0:3] # here it will go from 0 index to 2 not 3 


# we can add two strings as well
a = "heloo"
b = "world"
a + " " + b

# we can also add string with a number as well using str() function

a = 25
b ="street"

str(a)+' ' + b
